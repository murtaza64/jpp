      One of the last challenges for learners of Japanese to overcome is pronunciation, particularly Japanese unique pitch accents. 
      Some insist pronunciation is not crucial if we can make ourselves understood, and that we can communicate from the context.

      Oftentimes, a native speaker will be able to understand what you intended to say (or at least try to understand …..unless they 
      are not nice….), but it will make conversation much more difficult, tiring, and take longer to get your point across. However, 
      there are many educated, intellectually advanced students who write high-level essays, but when it comes to oral presentations, 
      discussions or debates, there are times when we hardly understand their intention due to pronunciation problems. This is truly 
      frustrating for them and for educators, especially when the content itself is superb, but sounds unintelligent.

      Proper intonation, the rise and fall of the voice in speaking, is critical to achieving Japanese fluency. 
      In some cases, improper intonation may change the meaning of a word, and other times may lead to an otherwise correct sentence 
      becoming incomprehensible to the listener. Intonating words correctly makes one&apos;s Japanese sound natural and professional.

      In extreme cases, improper intonation can change the entire meaning of a sentence or phrase! Take for example &quot;にほん.&quot; 
      When pronounced as &quot;に↴ほん,&quot; the meaning is &quot;two long objects.&quot; When pronounced as &quot;にほ↴ん,&quot; 
      the meaning is &quot;Japan.&quot; So the sentence, &quot;にほん、かいます,&quot; if pronounced properly, makes sense. 
      Maybe you are buying two pencils. However, if pronounced incorrectly the meaning changes to &quot;I am going to buy Japan.&quot; 
      Wow! You must be pretty rich.
